<pre style="font-size:120%; font-family:helvetica; text-align:center; color:turquoise;">I am a director based in Melbourne with an
interest in questioning how stories are told and
using film as a search for meaning.

I am autistic and attribute to this a fascination
with social interactions as having game-like
qualities and rules.

I studied at the Victorian College of the Arts;
I directed <i>Journey's End</i> (2023) as my graduating
film, which was shot on 16mm film. I have since
worked in archive producing and research in
episodic and feature work.

I am currently writing my next short, titled
<i>Quarters</i>, about a misdelivered letter and the
accidental recipient's attempt to return it to
the intended recipient.</p>
